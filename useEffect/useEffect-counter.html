      INSTRUCTIONS:

      Using the React hook, useEffect, declare a useEffect that will utilize the JavaScript method,
      setInterval(), in order to use update the `counter` state to be updated by 1 every 
      second (1000ms) when the component first mounts to the browser. Additionally, 
      have it console log the string "Counter Mounted!".

      A button has been included in the initial code which has the ability to unmount the `Counter`
      component. Using the useEffect hook that you just created, write some code that will stop the 
      counter interval and console log "Counter Unmounted!". Using the button provided, you will
      be able to toggle the counter component on and off. The goal is to show the console logs
      between the mounting and unmounting and to toggle the interval with no errors present
      in the console. If working, the counter will reset to 0 in between mountings.
    -->

    <script type="text/babel">

      const Counter = () => {
        const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(0)
        
        {/* create your useEffect below */}
        

        {/* your code goes above this line... */}

        return(
        <div>
          <h1>Counter : {counter}</h1>
        </div>
        )
      }

      const ExampleUseEffect = () => {
        const [showCounter, setShowCounter] = React.useState(true)
        return(
          <div>
            {showCounter ? <Counter /> : null }
            <button onClick={()=> setShowCounter(!showCounter)}>
              {showCounter ? "Hide Counter" : "Show Counter"}
            </button>
          </div>  
        )
      }

      ReactDOM.render(<ExampleUseEffect />, document.getElementById('root'))
